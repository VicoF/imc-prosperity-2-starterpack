# üêö IMC Prosperity 2 Starterpack

This repository contains the starterpack for the second IMC Prosperity challenge (2024).
The trader algorithm is very basic, but contains all the logic needed to send orders.

## Getting started

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account and clone it to your local machine.

2. Upload the `trader.py` file to the IMC Prosperity 2 platform to have a first working version of the trader algorithm.

3. Start developing your own trading algorithm by modifying the `trader.py` file.

4. Enjoy the challenge and good luck!
